# EXAMPLE 01: Manual controlled explorer and fixed rescue plan
This example allows the user to control the explorer agent with commands given by the keyboard. Upon reaching the time limit, the explorer agent calls the rescuer, which in turn executes a plan stored in memory.

How to use:
- copy the explorer.py, rescuer.py, and main.py to the chosen folder **[target]**
- copy the **[vs]** folder to the **[target]** folder

You should get a structure like:

+ **[target]**
   + main.py
   + rescuer.py
   + explorer.py
   + **[vs]**
      + all the VictimSim .py
